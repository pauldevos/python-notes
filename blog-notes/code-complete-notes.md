0. Problem Statement:
    - “We want to predict building energy demand accurately 7 days in advance to help building engineers prepare for the next week.”
1. POC (Jupyter Notebook)
    - Try to solve for project requirments (e.g. 10% error, 90% success)
    - Perhaps some performance benchmarks (simpler is better for compute)
2. Refactor Code
    - Build Functions, Classes, and Modules
    - Performance Tuning (e.g. Loops to Vectorization, C based libraries, etc)
3. Serialize Model for consumption into Serving (API) Software
